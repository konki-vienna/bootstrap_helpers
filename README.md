* Grid with outer gutter (`CTRL` + `Shift`+ `CMD` + `0`)  

### 2. Move and in-/decrease width of layers according to the bootstrap grid
* Move selected layer(s) left (`CTRL` + `Shift`+ `←`)
* Move selected layer(s) right (`CTRL` + `Shift`+ `→`)
* Increase selected layer(s) in width (`CTRL` + `Shift`+ `+`)

* ...
